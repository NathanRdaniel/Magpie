I/want
If statement is I want food so that i can eat.
the bot repsonds with "Would you really be happy if you had food so that i can eat?"
to fix this you have a detector for I in there so that when i is found after the i want statement it will change i to you and then say "Would you really be happy if you had food so that you can eat?"

I / You
When you respond with I have some food do you want some?
its resoponce would be "Why do you have food do me?"
to improve it we look at if the person is asking the bot the question so it will return with a responce for that question.
