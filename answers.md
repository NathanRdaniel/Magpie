when multiple statements it will choose priority of what first apears on the list of if statemnts so with *My mother has a dog but no cat.* the first if statement is the No, why so negitive responce so it chose that. but with *My mother has a dog.* for me the next if statements are about pets so it responded with "Tell me more about your pets."

1) When the word is inbeded into a word, The responce will pick it up because it dosent know that its in a word so it will still use the responce that the imbeded word has.
